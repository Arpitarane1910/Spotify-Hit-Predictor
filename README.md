# Spotify-Hit-Predictor

Our project analyzes a dataset of songs from the 2010s to uncover factors influencing their success. We clean and explore the data, conduct statistical analysis, and use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for machine learning modeling to predict hit songs. Outlier detection enhances our understanding of data variability. Through this analysis, we aim to provide insights into the determinants of song success in the modern music landscape.
